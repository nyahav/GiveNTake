**Given'Take** is an app designed to foster a supportive community where individuals can ask for help and offer assistance to others. By connecting people who need help with those willing to provide it, Give & Take aims to build stronger, more connected communities through acts of kindness and mutual support.

This app was made as a project in the Seminar course in Open University of Israel, "Cloud and Network: applications developing". 
The application is being developed as part of an internship program at Microsoft.
